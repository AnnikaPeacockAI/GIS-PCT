# GIS-PCT

## About The Project
The GIS-PCT is an open source initiative aimed at enhancing the experiences of hikers and trail angels on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Leveraging QGIS for mapping, Python for backend operations, and JavaScript for interactive user interfaces, this project aims to deliver an engaging and informative dashboard. With a focus on smart data use and community engagement, the GIS-PCT ensures vital information about trail conditions, weather, and resources is freely accessible to improve outcomes for all trail users.

### Built With

- **[Python](https://python.org)**: For data processing, scripting, and API interactions.
- **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**: For developing responsive and interactive web interfaces.

### Accelerated by AI
The development process is accelerated with the support of LLMs including ChatWithRTX,ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
